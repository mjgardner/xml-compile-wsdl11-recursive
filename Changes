Revision history for perl module XML::CompileX::Schema::Loader

0.003     2015-01-06 16:48:40-08:00 America/Los_Angeles
    - do not force the user to load XML::Compile::SOAP11 or
      XML::Compile::Transport::SOAPHTTP since they may not need them
    - simplify tests and examples to reflect the above and not duplicate URIs
      in both WSDL11 and Loader construction
0.002     2015-01-06 13:45:40-08:00 America/Los_Angeles (TRIAL RELEASE)
    - Renamed from XML::Compile::WSDL11::Recursive to
      XML::CompileX::Schema::Loader per suggestion from Mark Overmeer
    - Remove not-quite-there caching in favor of just letting the specified
      user_agent handle it (e.g., with WWW::Mechanize::Cached)
    - support adding multiple WSDL URIs on construction
    - handle both schema include and import statements
    - rewrite to work alongside XML::Compile::WSDL11 rather than using
      an attribute as a proxy object
0.001     2015-01-01 16:04:27-05:00 America/New_York (TRIAL RELEASE)
