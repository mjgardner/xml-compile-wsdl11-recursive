The examples in this directory demonstrate how to use
XML::CompileX::Schema::Loader to save WSDL and schema documents from the
network onto the local file system, and then use XML::Compile::WSDL11 to load
them without having to retrieve them again.

USAGE:

    $ perl save_wsdl_schema.pl <URLs of WSDL and XSD files...>
    
    $ perl load_wsdl_schema.pl <list of saved WSDL and XSD files...>

save_wsdl_schema.pl will save its results into the current directory, with
subdirectories created for the protocol (http or https), host name(s), and
paths to the loaded documents.

load_wsdl_schema.pl will load all WSDL and XSD files you specify, compile them,
and then report on the available SOAP operations and schema elements.
